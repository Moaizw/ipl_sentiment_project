>The season for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) has gone from bad to worse as they still remain at the bottom of the table with only two wins and six losses. This could also mean that their chances of making it to the playoffs has potentially ended as well.

>The last game was another disappointing outing for the Yellow Brigade, losing to one of their biggest rivals, in Mumbai Indians, at the Wankhede Stadium. There is a lot of criticism being directed towards the MS Dhoni-led side, even from former CSK players like Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh, who expressed their disappointment during commentary. Raina said that the auction did not go well for the team. He added that they did not even bid for certain star players

There were so many talented players and youngsters in the auction. Where are they? You went to the auction with so much money but left Pant, Iyer, and Rahul. I have never seen CSK struggle like this),‚Äù Raina said while commentating during the game as quoted by Hindustan Times




>talent scouts should be questioned: Harbhajan Singh



>While Raina blamed the auction, former legendary off-spinner Harbhajan Singh also blamed the scouting group of the CSK setup. Harbhajan said that the people behind the selections should be questioned and mentioned that there does not seem to be a game-changing young player within the setup.



>CSK bohot badi team rahi hai. Jab yeh auction main gaye, inke paas woh option tha unn players ko le sakte the. Yuvaon main bhi waise yuva dikhe nahi jo game-changing wali innings khel sake.

Let's list some of the hard things they have to endure in this long tournament and be sympathetic towards them for once. I know most of your think they are earning a lot but they still have to show up everyday and almost expected to perform at peak.

I will start

1. Playing in extreme heat - Temperatures in most grounds are in late 30s - early 40s

2. Constant Traveling - almost every other day. Buses, flights, packing, unpacking can be a lot on your body

3. Sleeping late (games finish at midnight, by the time you get to hotel it's already well past 2am)

4. Constant social media - Every team has a social media channel and players have to do silly things to generate views even though they are not comfortable. (Dancing, Constantly being asked ro Speak in Hindi just to entertain Indian audience)

5. Adjusting to food - Especially if you're a foreign player you can get homesick

6. Mental Health - Loss of form, in/out from the team can be difficult to deal with when you have a game every other day


What else can you think of?

CSK‚Äôs Decline Is Not An Aberration Anymore

LIKE all of you I‚Äôm a massive fan of THALA DHONI & CSK from year 1 & will be for a lifetime.

However, outside of fandom, If I see objectively this is the worst CSK XI that has played in terms of batting line up. 

CSK used to be a home of swashbuckling openers like HAYDEN, WATSON, HUSSEY, VIJAY, etc

That opening combination is missing very badly. We had the most solid 3 & 4 in RAINA & BADRINATH & then RAYADU this middle order compared to that is very very fragile.

RUTURAJ as a leader lacks confidence leave aside that he not added value as a batsman this time & why he moved to no.3 is out of my mind.

Spinning combo of ASH & JADDU not that brutal anymore. NOOR is more relied upon. 

MSD is not that finisher who can turn the match on his head everyday.

I see the signs of a very bad season in 2025. I may be wrong üòë and will be happy if proven wrong but this team doesn‚Äôt going to playoffs IMO. 

We need a total rehaul, MSD as mentor, bring new coach & leave old guards now bring in new players fresh mindsets & that is the only way our legacy will survive.

This may hurt many CSK fans & me also but I think time has come up not to SUGARCOAT things anymore.

What‚Äôs your take?"

1k42jmv,Most disappointing player this IPL?,unlinedd,133,68,https://i.redd.it/r210890bj3we1.jpeg,"SRH has been badly underperforming this season even though in theory have good players. Part of it is that the coaching staff seem not good enough (batting/bowling coaches perhaps the most inexperienced). It just seems bowlers (except Cummins and Harshal) just come and bowl whatever they want without any plan, and there seems to be no plans B and C for batting either.

And part of it is that so many players are underperforming at the same time.

But the biggest concern I think is Ishan Kishan.

Abhishek Sharma hasn't been good. He had a hundred and a decent score last game but nothing in other games. Nitish Kumar Reddy has been disappointing. He was terrible with both bat and field, though he was excellent on the field last game. Shami has been in really bad form too, conceding the highest number of runs in a match by an Indian (missing the record by one run). He was bowling one full toss after another in the 20th over to Stoinos who was hitting him for 6 after 6.

Here's the thing though. Even if the rest of the IPL also goes terrible for them, they will still be playing for the national team. Abhishek/Nitish should continue to get chances. Shami is definitely going to England Test series (though unlikely to play T20Is unless there are multiple injuries at the same time).

But Ishan Kishan is completely out of the national team picture. The only way back for him is to consitently perform so well that the selectors can't ignore him and are forced to take him back. We know he has the talent.

As of now, his juniors are ahead of him in terms of national team selection, his seniors, players who played with him, basically everyone is ahead of him.

He had a 100 first game. He said that Travis Head told him to block a few balls if he's uncomfortable. He did block a few balls in the first game. After the first game though, it's been one disappointment after another. And he's had so many chances. He's been unlucky at times too, sure, but it's been so many games now.

What do you think about this? Can he turn it around the rest of the season? Does he really not have the hunger to prove himself? Does he not care about getting back to the Indian team?

Or has any other player been more disappointing?"

* Virat Kohli ‚Äì 59\*(36) vs KKR, 67(42) vs MI, 63(45) vs RR, ‚Äã73\*(54) vs PBKS

* Liam Livingstone ‚Äì 54(40) vs GT

Only Jitesh Sharma is yet to register his half-century, but nonetheless would appreciate his crucial 40\*(19) vs MI.

It's heartening to witness that we have everyone contributing, still half the way around the tournament, unlike from the past where the team heavily relied on one or two players to carry them over the season/or you'd see a collapse incoming.

The only problem I have with the batting unit is to assess the conditions and then play, not have a target set in the mind while walking down the pitch and batting first, it seems like we already got the target of 210/220 set in the mind knowing it is Chinnaswamy and we are trying to chase in first innings, we really need our batters to assess (especially from likes of Kohli, RaPa) the pitch and play, from what I have observed of the 3 games at the pitch tends to be challenging in the initial 7-8 overs, gradually becoming more favorable for batting as the game progresses. We have got Tim to play the last 3 overs, but we don't want him to be at the crease in 11-12 overs and restrain him from his natural game.

We have got a solid bowling unit putting in efforts and not letting the game out of our hands real-quick (unlike previous seasons)."

CSK players wear black armbands in tribute during IPL 2025 clash
The players of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) were seen sporting black armbands during Match 38 of the ongoing edition of the IPL 2025 (Indian Premier League) against Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday, April 20. There has been no official statement from the franchise up until now.

>However, renowned anchor Harsha Bhogle revealed the reason during the post-match presentation. The CSK players wore the armbands as a mark of respect for Devon Conway's father, Philip Conway, who unfortunately passed away at an unconfirmed date in the recent past. Notably, the Kiwi top-order batter did not feature in the recently concluded fixture.


>Conway last played for CSK on April 11 against Kolkata Knight Riders at Chepauk. He did not feature for the franchise in their away fixture against Lucknow Super Giants. However, there was no official communication from the side as to why he was sidelined against LSG. Conway has played three innings this season so far. Notably, his 69-run knock against Punjab Kings came in a losing cause."

1k3pb8o,Why does CSK keep playing Overton over Brevis when Overton hardly even bowls? Makes no sense,ryanmo28,7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipl/comments/1k3pb8o/why_does_csk_keep_playing_overton_over_brevis/,"Okay, can someone explain this logic to me? CSK keeps picking Overton in the XI but barely bowls him. In the last few games, he‚Äôs bowled maybe one or two overs max, or sometimes not at all. If you're not going to use him as a proper bowler, what's the point?

On the other hand, you've got Dewald Brevis‚Äîexplosive young batter, capable of turning a game around in a few overs, and has been waiting in the wings forever. CSK clearly lacks some firepower in the middle order right now, especially when the top 3 don‚Äôt fire. Brevis could easily come in and fill that gap. He‚Äôs also a decent part-time spinner if needed, so it‚Äôs not like you're losing all-round ability entirely.

What‚Äôs even weirder is that Overton isn‚Äôt even contributing much with the bat either. If you're playing a foreign slot for someone who's barely bowling and not batting impactfully, why not just go for a proper batter?

This isn‚Äôt even a hate post on Overton, but the team balance just isn‚Äôt working with how he‚Äôs being used. Thoughts?"

Can they continue their run? We'd have to wait and see. One thing is clear, there are no easy teams. It is anybody's game. But, let's take a look back at the first half of the tournament and rate the performances of your team and players.

He bowls the last over ? Nice , he is always like the impact player for the opposition, 169 to 188 againt dc in the last over and 153 to 180 vs lsg , and he is still and will probly be in the next game playing 11 üòÇ üôè what a joke , why dont they try madhwal i thought, then again i remember which team it is üíÄ

‚Ä¢ Now , jurel and hetmyre ? Jurel is the one playing like he is a 14 yo playing his debut , whereas our great finisher hetmyre , someone give him batting tutorials coz like comon ur playin on an international level , and the only thing u do is close the eyes , swing the bat to the leg side and hope that it connects , wtf ? Both of these took 25 crs frm the auction purse and this is what they do ? Cannot chase 9 in 6 balls in back to back matches ? These were choosen over buttler ? Tell me ur a clown without telling me ü§°üôè

‚Ä¢ And , how can i forget the great dravid ? All this is mainly coz of him , cannot only blame the players when u have such stupid coaches and management, tho they are also to be blamed , bro really saw rr at its peak and in his stupid old fashion was like : ""hmm , rr doing good? I cannot witness tht , time to f things up‚Äù ü´°üôè

I‚Äôd say thts enough for now , should be blaming myself to still be expecting smthin frm this stupid management/team"

Kohli is a legend (one of not the best batsman for India and one if not the best test captain for India) but there were a few kinks in his captaincy. Many players have eluded to  presence of favouritism in the team. In fact, by the end of his captaincy, the Indian team was in such bad shape that apparently the team was split in two, some in favour of Rohit and some in favour of Kohli.

Rayudu was in the form of his life in 2018, and the beginning of 2019. But then he wasn‚Äôt selected for the World Cup, after Dhawan was ruled out and KL had to come for opening, there was a gap in the fourth spot in the team.

And even I can‚Äôt believe who and all they brought in 

Dk (wasn‚Äôt at all in form)
Vijay Shankar (3d player who broke all laws and became 0 dimensional player)
Mayank Agarwal (bro what?)
And then they settled on Rishab pant (literally had no experience before then)

All these over an inform Rayudu who had an avg of 47 in odi. I really cannot think of a single reason other than favouritism for not picking him. 

At this time MSD and CSK management repeatedly gave him chances to play, bought him every auction and gave him a fairy tale ending to his career where he played a very important cameo in an already super close match. That day, he was in the centre holding his 6th ipl trophy. From his perspective MSD is his god. 

Rayudu is a villain. But he is one of those villains who deserves to be one. To me his commentary not irritating, it just adds more masala to a league that already thrives on drama, especially because it seems like he is now purposefully leaning into the hate

I had high hopes from - Ravi Bishnoi and Rahul Chahar but they are not even getting a game properly.

In Chennai Noor Ahmad is doing well but same time it looks like Ashwin and Jadeja has lost their charm. 

Chahal bounced back but I had hope from Harpreet Brar as he can bat as well let's see if he get more chances 


Vipraj Nigam and one Mumbai Spinner did well in 1-2 games still they haven't got much game or full 4 over quota when they are playing.

Sai Kishore is doing well still in some match not getting full Quota.

Kuldeep Yadav continues to dominate. Varun C is having an average season.

W Sundar is not bowling.

Krunal Pandya is someone I wish get an opportunity in ICT. 

From ICT's Point of view 

Best Spinner - Kuldeep Yadav

Average Spinners - V Chakravarthy, Axar Patel, R Jadeja

Future Star - Sai Kishore and who???

In ODI cricket, he has played 27 innings, scoring 871 runs with an average of 33.5 at a strike rate of 106.2.  In T20Is, he has played 66 innings, scoring 1209 runs with an average of 23.2 at a strike rate of 127.3.

These stats don't seem great; at best, they're decent.

Considering his IPL stats, for Delhi Daredevils, he played 38 innings, scoring 1248 runs with an average of 35.66 at a strike rate of 162.71. For Delhi Capitals, he played 72 innings, scoring 2035 runs with an average of 35.09 at a strike rate of 141.52.

These stats are very impressive and speak volumes about his skills. With LSG buying him at the auction for ‚Çπ27 crore, do you think the price is affecting his performance? His captaincy has been good, with a few wrong calls. However, his batting has been poor‚Äî106 runs in 108 balls in 7 innings. Could the venue be a factor? Even if so, is this acceptable?"

Sai Kishore who was benched by CSK for eternity, has slowly got his reckoning and despite of having quality spinners like Rashid, Noor, Jayant Yadav, slowly made his mark in 2022 and 2023 and come 2024 he was a regular feature in the XI. His potential was clearly recognised by GT and despite of having players like Shami, Miller in mega auction they used their only RTM to retain Sai Kishore.

5. Mohammad Siraj, clearly infamous for his inconsistency and volatile perfomances, seems to have found a home at GT. Just like Shami he is a rhythm bowler and needs hands on his shoulder to give a freedom to execute his plans on the field without fear of failure.

6. Prasidhh Krishna, this is the most impactful story so far. Many cricket pundits have written him off and labelled him as a red ball bolwer critisizing his tendency of going for runs. While that's true, there's some work done behind the doors and you can see that. Nehra & co. are clearly smart and understands the game of individuals. They haven't given new ball to krishna and used him in middle overs and asked him to back his natural strength which is back (hit the deck hard) of the length. Guy looks to be so calm and comfortable in the role he is expected to perform.

7. This is not the end of the list there are a few more names like Yash Dayal, Joshua little who in a brief time he played looked like starc and was backed a lot by the management.

You have to agree with the fact that GT has cultivated a team philosophy that even in the worlds of 250+ scores in t20 they are consistently banking on their bolwers to win you games in otherwise batting paradies.

In 2025 where teams are batting till 9-10, GT is happy playing Rashid at no.7 and playing 6 genuine bowlers every match and not to mention they are not even bowling their part timers like SRK Tewatia even Washington!

But shouldn‚Äôt there be talks about the player performances as well? To my RCB bros- aren‚Äôt you frustrated by the following from yesterday‚Äôs match:
1. Poor form of Livingstone
2. Low game awareness by Jitesh
3. Krunal‚Äôs crass bowling to release pressure
4. A strategic miss to bowl Suyash in the 10th over instead of Bhuvi/Yash

I can still understand fans talking about the toss curse or the home ground curse, but even their social media is indirectly blaming toss for a 42-7 performance. 

I saw the match live in the stadium, and trust me, the support they get from the home crowd is crazy enough to pressurise the opposition. The fans are RCB‚Äôs biggest home advantage, but they still end up bottling in Bengaluru.

PS- Nothing against the passion of the fans. Let‚Äôs just acknowledge that oppositions have outplayed RCB at home, instead of blaming external factors.

So, the only time PBKS have won on April 18th (1 win out of 6 games, before yesterday's game against RCB) & 20th (1 win out of 6 games, tomorrow again vs RCB), was in 2014, the only season they made it all the way till the finals. So, yesterday's dominant victory (and tomorrow's potential victory against the same opponent, since Shreyas Iyer has a terrific captaincy record against RCB with 7 wins out of 9 games + the eternal kryptonites of RCB, i.e., Brar, Chahal & Jansen) definitely gives hope for PBKS fans after years of blowing hot & cold. Also, with Iyer having a point to prove (despite ending up as finalist for DC & winner for KKR), this team look even more potent & dangerous. 

Plus, there's one more coincidence w.r.t to Iyer as a captain. While his team (2024 KKR & 2025 PBKS) has been at the receiving end of letting his opponent chase the highest score successfully (PBKS in 2024 & SRH in 2025), it's only post these losses that their bowling attacks turned even more potent (2024 KKR beating MI at the Wankhede & bundling out SRH for 113 in the final, 2025 PBKS defending the lowest ever total of 111 against KKR).

So, all in all, I definitely had a feeling that PBKS is going to be the team to watch out for this year (like KKR & SRH last year) & so far I've been proven right. Hopefully, they win go all the way & win that elusive trophy, of course who doesn't want an underdog to win?? Cheers!!"

This is just my opinion but I think this is now the strongest 12 for games with the addition of brevis who seems to be brought in to solve the middle order struggles. I‚Äôve included nagarkoti due to his pace and he‚Äôs had some time out so can be an X factor bowler for us. 

I personally favour Ellis over Pathirana. Pathirana has been too expensive this year and inconsistent, and with only 7 wickets, his selection isn‚Äôt solidified. Ellis is one of the most trusted, sought after and skilled bowlers on the franchise circuit and it makes no sense to not give him a proper go, especially on the slower Chennai pitches.

Instead I have a suggestion:
If both teams want to bowl first (as in this case) they should make wager on how many runs the opposition starts with. Whoever wagers higher gets to bowl first. So if one teams wagers 10 other wagers 20, the second team bowls first but the the first team starts with 20/0

If both teams want to bat first, they wager how many fewer balls they are willing to face. If one team wagers 3, second one 6 then second team bats first but the innings is only of 19 overs

This introduces an element of strategy compared to the blind luck of winning the toss. What‚Äôs the optimal advantage you think bowling or batting first gives? What are you willing to trade for it? What‚Äôs might the opposition wager? What should be your response to it?

Chess Does something similar - it‚Äôs an advantage to play white. So if you want to play white you have to wager how much time less you are willing to have to play white. Whoever wagers more gets white. (Not all chess games, but some specific formats)"

I'm here to ask your opinions about how you rate a franchise successful by trophies or how consistent they are. I personally rate them with trophies instead of playoffs. I have a simple reasoning behind it ipl end goal is to win trophies not reach playoffs some people say winning a season can be considered a fluke but I believe that's not true at all you have to outdo all the teams that season to win it. So I would like everyone's opinion on this would you rate a franchise like rr more successful than rcb? Cause they won a trophy but not consistent at all. I believe playoffs can only be used as tiebreaker. So for you being successful means winning a trophy or  being consistent

1k1y7lb,How the IPL25 season is going so far.,Stoutcork,416,180,https://i.redd.it/onc5oka8ejve1.jpeg,"As half of the IPL is nearly over 

My take GT , DC and PBKS are confirmed for playoffs with LSG and RCB being close contendors but if you see the bottom 6 teams only MI is the team who can qualify for the playoffs they should have atleast like 1 more victory if Tilak would have connected with the bat against LSG. 

My take- KKR and RR are shitting in this IPL with CSK showing no intend in batting. 

I dont know if SRH should even be considered 
' Dangerous ' PBKS fumbled catches that's why they lost against SRH and that was there only victory alongside sgainst RR which are SHIT. 

LSG should have won against CSK if only for 2 lucky 4s from MS and those wide plus no balls in the end overs. LSG should have also won against DC in the 1st match but they fumbled followed by Vipraj and Ashutosh finishing the game.

RCB opners always give them a good start with Rajat bashing spin bowling. But I have a felling that RCB will either loose or win both their matches against PBKS. ( I REPEAT IT'S A ' PREDICTION ' )

Please explain to me why a batsman shouldn‚Äôt be penalised for stealing a few yards of a run?

Their formula was simple: one top-order batter (usually Warner) would carry the bulk of the runs, while their bowlers defended modest totals with precision. 

But over-reliance on Warner and a weak, neglected middle order eventually caught up with them. Despite regular playoff appearances from 2016 to 2020, SRH never evolved. Once the results stopped coming, the cracks became too big to ignore.

Now, SRH looks like a team without identity‚Äîcaught between past success and present confusion. "

So, IPL 2024 is when we got introduced to this new version of SRH, Travishek wreaked havoc in every game and every team genuinely feared facing it. Atleast according to social media buzz and the commentators.

-But, if you observe closely, it has been a slogging carnival for them all along. Last year, almost all the grounds had super flat pitches and SRH fancied on this very well.

-Whenever they were presented with a balanced track, they struggled. This was obvious during their Chennai games(League and playoffs).

Forget the playoffs, even during their league game against CSK, MI, GT(mind you, none of these made it to the playoffs), their batting order collapsed.
Their only game against LSG happened at Hyd, they didn't play at Ekana.

-Whenever this happened, they'd be back in Uppal and their highway pitches were tailor-made for sloggers. 
Even their away game wins followed a similar trend.
Chinnasway(Haven for batsmen even before 2024) and Arun Jaitley(in which 465 runs were scored both innings combined).
Only exception was their game against KXIP.

-Infact, people were disappointed and surprised by the fact that KKR had won in the final, when it was a far balanced side. The only time they could compete with them was when they were playing at Hyd(lost by 4 runs).

-This year, Travishek haven't clicked and most importantly, pitches are ultra-flat like last year. Hence, their batting looks clueless. They started losing games and instead of changing their strategy, went back to flattening out the pitch again during PBKS game and got lucky.

Again, I'm no hater of SRH. I'd be very happy if they improvise, come up with new strategies and surprise me, but this won't take them far."

Today there are no SRH fans and the crowd is just so dull and soft consistently. Even after MI were dominating with the ball, the cheers after each wicket were relatively muted and shortlived.

The DJ tries to rev the crowd up and it sounds like only a handful of spectators pay heed and chant for five seconds.

This is based on what I'm hearing on the TV.

What's the reason for this?"

It was against RCB he threw the coin behind him and faf du plesis knew the toss was fixed. They didn't show the coin on the camera. This year too he did it against KKR i think. 

And even today against SRH he threw coin away from himself. And ironically all of the instances happened at Wankhede where toss is the deciding factor of match. And dictates 90% of the match. Would love to know your opinion on this."

In the Indian Premier **League** (IPL), the team that finishes at the top of the league stage often doesn't receive the recognition it deserves. Unlike football leagues, where the team with the most consistent performance throughout the season is crowned champion, the IPL's playoff system means that a team can dominate the league stage but falter in the knockout rounds and end the season empty handed.

Do you think the team finishing first in the league stage should be recognized with a separate trophy?  
This will make every game extra competitive. "

I would consider this a greater victory than PBKS, coz comeback only happens after consecutive wins and we did have that in recent times, even last season, its mostly due to our approach which doesn't allow us consecutive wins, if this season we win these next 5 matches then it's like abhishek becoming consistent üíÄ yeah, that level of impossible

* From SRH: Harshal & Ehsan Maliga (both death overs)

Whether it‚Äôs those toe-crushing yorkers or the unplayable outswingers under lights, Starc‚Äôs presence has been nothing short of electric. His experience, pace, and intensity have added massive value to his team ‚Äî and fans have absolutely loved every minute of it.

From doubters to believers, he's silenced them all. Here's to Mitch Starc ‚Äî the thunderbolt who never lost his edge!!

Some shots flew over these fielders and dropped just outside the fence, some even dropped inside the fence and went for 4. Some were pulled back mid-air by fielders and their fielding was applauded. But all these were easy catches had the fielder been standing right back. It's a defensive approach for saving runs instead of taking wickets. What say?"

It is not like SRH venkatesh against LSG SR of 150 costed us the match more than SR just see that inning and see Patidar batting it is a stark difference he is just not in touch. Russel getting out on full toss against LSG was frustrating but now it has crossed the line, He is not in that form to take the game away from opposition. Ramandeep what can I say about this guy it is zero responsibility like zilch nada nil he is a basher but he has gotten chances where there are overs left like LSG, Punjab, MI game but lad has just disappointed. Ajinkya whom we all thought how he can get into 11 looks the only saving grace with Rinku apart from Narine trying to pull rabbbit out of his hat apart from that this batting line up is just not there not in touch to lift this trophy. Our bowling has a big hole of starc but it is still ok a bowling line up capable of lifting trophy but batting is just not there. 

After RCB game it felt like ok it is just one game middle order will not fall like this but then same happened against MI doubts started creeping in then LSG game it was just frustrating to watch throwing the 2 points away and then tomorrow you lost 4 games because your middle order is more fragile then a fucking pyramid of champagne glasses.

I think we should not expect this team to lift trophy this year maybe next year if batters get in touch we can have a go but this season I feel it is done and dusted this Middle order is nowhere close to what it should be. Our problem is not what SRH had ours is different we have seen them getting opportunity playing out balls taking their time still shitting losses so my hope for KKR challenging for trophy is over."
