1k4i41j,moaecs2,historyguy84,"As the other commenter said, it's not a 0 or 1 thing. Ball tracking, like every other technology, has a precision error that comes into play whenever the ball is in that uncertain zone on the sides/top of the stumps. They could just say that everything in that error zone is out or not out, but they choose to go with the umpire's call because as per the laws of cricket, technology is to assist the umpires who have the final say. There's even a law that says that if the fielding side doesn't appeal for a clear dismissal, the umpires don't have to give it out. Clearly cricket respects umpires way more than other sports do for their referees, and it's okay for now. Probably will change as the game evolves.",1,1745256860.0

‚Ä¢	‚Å†DC‚Äôs top 2 chances are higher because of the same reason. They either go all in and beat teams like RCB and GT or they lose altogether. This is known as a multimodal distribution.

How is the fixture difficulty translated numerically?

>DC‚Äôs top 2 chances are higher because of the same reason. They either go all in and beat teams like RCB and GT or they lose altogether.

These aren't the only two possibilities though. Most realistically, they will win some and lose some. 

>Also DC current form is poor. 2 losses in the last 3 and the 1 win came from a super over

Again, how is something like a super over win translated numerically? 


Another factor would be that RCB is winning all their away matches and losing all their home matches (true even now after more than half the season) which could be extrapolated to something like a 14 - 7 - 7 finish.

U can say he didn't get many chances. Dhoni got 10 shots at ICC tournaments (including 6 in WT20s) but Virat just got 3 out of which 1 was a Toss WC. He eventually would've won titles.

We required just 55 off 32 with 2 set batters on the crease, one being the greatest finisher of all time apparently. But instead of putting pressure we chose to leave balls and put pressure on ourselves instead just to take the game ""deep"" and suddenly the target became 32 off 14.

So don't bring up the top order choke again and again...the game was well and truly there to be won 30 overs after the top order collapsed, but for some reason blaming Dhoni is a problem. Dude played unnecessarily dot balls and leaves with required rate over 10 and undid all the hard work which Jadeja did.

It's actually surprising he batted in that embarrassing way especially after IPL 2018 and 2019 where he wasn't scared of his wicket and loved to put pressure on the opponent instead of playing dot balls and leaves and asking Jadeja to do the aggressive role.",0,1745228077.0

1k42jmv,mo8t6uj,Shadow_Clone_007,"SRH:

Kishan, yes.
Klaasen hasnt lived up to his retain amount (Kohli and Pooran have similar salaries but are top in orange cap list)
NKR was supposed to be the backbone of SRH this time, but they have been tumbling after Travishek fall. 

LSG:

Pant, 27cr but worst batting performances. Saving grace has been that LSG is doing really good despite their primary bowlers Mayank/Mohsin being injured. 

KKR:

Venky iyer hasnt looked at his best till now, looks like money overspent. 
Russell looks like a shell of his former self, needs to step up as KKR look to be stuck in the middle of the table.

RCB:

overspent on Rasikh but he hasnt played much. If he was going to be a backup why spend that high? (it was a RTM call)

Livi has been poor, someone like Phillips/Bracewell would have been a better buy for the same job.

CSK: 
They didnt make too expensive buys but I would say Ashwin, for the amount he has been paid, isnt living up to it. 

Rachin wasnt that expensive, but he had lots of expectations but has failed continuously.

Hooda/Tripathi have been pathetic.

MI: 

Jacks needs to go back to his 2024 RCB form, this will literally make MI end up in top2 given their legacy.
Chahar has scope for improvement too.

DC:  JFM. everyone else has contributed, except faf who has been injured so wont include him here.

RR: oh, too big a list. All their retentions have fumbled games. No one looking like a matchwinner. Jaiswal giving away wicket after scoring 50s. 

GT: They look really complete, just that Rashid is such a big player - his recent performances look mediocre.

PBKS: 
Maxi has been poor. Shreyas showed good signs initially but got out for cheap in last 3 games. Stoinis will be a X factor going forward. Their Indian core has been excellent though.",1,1745237578.0

1. RCB 2009 (Finished 4th)


They rode a wave late in the league stage and made it to the final under the old system. If the current format was in place, they‚Äôd have faced a steeper path, maybe wouldn't have made it that far.




2. Deccan Chargers 2009 (Finished 2nd)


They won the IPL that year, despite a rocky group stage. With today's format, they might have had to beat more consistent teams twice. Not a sure thing.




3. Kolkata Knight Riders 2014


Won 9 in a row to lift the trophy. But imagine if they had a semifinal format instead of the extra advantage from finishing in the top 2‚Äîthey could‚Äôve gone out in one knockout game.




4. Sunrisers Hyderabad 2016


Another great example‚Äî4th in league stage, then beat the top teams back-to-back to win the title. If that season had the Qualifier 1/2 format, the psychological and structural disadvantage could‚Äôve tripped them up.",2,1745213623.0

1k3ttkb,mo5c0b4,patel4994,"Let's analyze the sequence:
0, 8, 13, 17, 18, 26, 76, ?

We'll look at the differences between consecutive terms:

8 - 0 = 8

13 - 8 = 5

17 - 13 = 4

18 - 17 = 1

26 - 18 = 8

76 - 26 = 50


Now observe the pattern in differences:
8, 5, 4, 1, 8, 50

The pattern seems irregular, but let‚Äôs try to find any repetition or logic.

Looking at the jump from 18 to 26 (+8) and then 26 to 76 (+50) ‚Äî a big leap ‚Äî maybe a hidden pattern or a mathematical function is in play.

Let‚Äôs try checking:

18 to 26 is +8

26 to 76 is +50


It might be that the large jump (50) relates to a pattern resetting.

Another way to look at it:
The 6th term is 76, which is 26 √ó 2 + 24
That may not help directly.

Let‚Äôs check a possible next jump: If the previous jump was +50, and if that jump is increasing dramatically, maybe:

Try to continue the pattern of jumps:
8, 5, 4, 1, 8, 50 ‚Üí next could be 49 (decrease by 1?)

Then:
76 + 49 = 125

Alternatively, observe that:

0 to 8 = 2¬≥

8 to 13 = +5

13 to 17 = +4

17 to 18 = +1

18 to 26 = +8

26 to 76 = +50


Still irregular...

Possibility: It's a custom or puzzle-based sequence, maybe the differences are primes or derived from another logic.

But based on the pattern of adding 8 and 50 near the end, a reasonable guess would be:

Next number = 76 + 49 = 125

So, the next number is likely 125 (according to all knowing Chatgpt).",8,1745181332.0

Personally don't think it's a fanbase or even a cricket problem. I think it's just people's discontentment towards life, which they are channeling through social media or any chance wherever there is some kind of majority in their favor.

Fact of the matter is: the Chinnaswamy crowd tends to be aggressive. And that kind of crowd mentality only intensifies things further. RCB fans really need to step up and fix this, because it‚Äôs not a good look.

1k3s44a,mo7usvw,Original-Mountain653,"Maturity is when you realise sports fandom itself is inevitably toxic. Every IPL franchise is essentially a corporate brand. Fanaticism just brings those teams more revenue. How do they make fans act like this?
Name your franchise after a region even though the franchise has got nothing to do with the region except that it's just based there (KL Rahul from Bangalore plays for DC, Kohli from Delhi plays for RCB), create emotional narratives around every franchise, try to associate every team with some star players so people can fight like dogs about the players they support as well.

You can troll me all you want but the truth is what I just said. Hardcore IPL fans have a tribalistic idea of being a fan. You just have to take the middle ground: you can support your team without trolling other teams, view players as players and not demigods. And view franchises as franchises. Not your identity. Even if CSK screws up this year, it's the fans who are going to whine about a team of athletes who don't even know those fans exist. Those teams will continue to play games and receive huge salaries.

One person commented that IPL has ruined cricket, and they didn't gave any valid criticism like how it's just a slog fest, no competition between bat and ball, monopoly or something like that.

And one can't compare cricket to football. Cricket is a slow sport with tons of breaks and ads that break the flow of the game. It is not as athletic as the ISL.

The ISL can't be compared to the IPL because fans in the ISL really care for their respective team because it represents their city and culture. 

And since football is a shorter sport with little to no ads and breaks, it can be easily watched in a stadium.

You shouldn't be celebrating because it's the team which won

Finn Allen is a much better T20 player for both NZ and in franchise cricket

He didn't get chances at RCB cuz of the Faf-Virat opening pair and other teams didn't bid for him thinking that he's an NZ bully 

Rachin is not even an NZ bully in T20I's

I'd give credit to Rachin for being a great prospect in ODI and Test format

The only time CSK has come useful for him was that he used their training facilities for a few weeks last year before playing that test series in India where NZ completely whitewashed us and dealt a blow to our chances to qualify for the 23-25 WTC final before we got dethroned in BGT at Australia

He is immensely talented and the talk in Hyderabad cricket circles was that he was the next Sachin. 

But, with talent, he also had a lot of attitude. Nothing unusual. He picked up fights on and off the ground with the powers to be then. Arjun Yadav, Shivlal Yadav‚Äôs son had a constant fight with him because Arjun was captain of the team and Rayudu was not listening to him on the field.

Of course Rayudu might have his reasons and HCA officials are no saints. They are infact one of the most corrupt organisations in Indian Cricket. 

He got unofficial banned in Hyderabad cricket, tried morning to Andhra or Chhattisgarh but still had his share of problems. He also joined ICL, IPLs rival tournament at the risk of getting banned by BCCI and not playing for India ever. Because he never thought he‚Äôll even get selected. 

I think only because of Mumbai Indians and their clout, he got back into IPL and then got into CSK ecosystem and to ICT. 

I only wonder how much Indian cricket would have benefited if only it has Rayudu playing regularly from the start of his career, without controversies. Raw talent wise, he‚Äôs on par with Rohit or Virat.

247 runs at an avg of 30.8 and sr of 75 isn't form of life by any means.

This topic has been done to death. Rayadu wasn't some bradman sitting on the bench who would have guaranteed our victory. And neither is the management and captain such vindictive that they would jeopardize the whole campaign due to a grudge. We can all now speak in hindsight. Had the result been different, say the bowling had failed then we would have blamed why bench so and so player etc.

Rayadu takes things to his heart. Is a short tempered guy, who feels he was wronged so he continues to bring it up time and time again. And he would continue to do so. That's one thing which will always keep him in news. There is for sure going to be a tell all book in future for sure.

But let‚Äôs be honest, if Virat had truly wanted Rayudu in the squad, there‚Äôs no way MSK had the authority to overrule that. Everyone knows how these things work behind the scenes.

In a recent Telugu podcast, Rayudu himself mentioned that he had even received his Indian team jersey for the World Cup. That‚Äôs how certain his selection was, only to be dropped last minute. No one deserves to be treated like that. And honestly, it's not just about Rayudu.

Take Karun Nair for example. The guy scored a triple century, then had a few low scores, and suddenly he was out. He was picked for the England Test tour in 2018 under Virat‚Äôs captaincy-a five-match series where India was struggling. Karun was in the squad the whole time but never got a game. Then out of nowhere, they flew in Hanuma Vihari and played him ahead of Karun.Then they dropped him from squad without any explanation. Imagine being there, getting sidelined like that. The psychological toll must‚Äôve been huge.

Every time Karun scores now, most of us feel genuinely happy for him because we know how unfairly he was treated. The guy hit rock bottom but never gave up. And now? He‚Äôs not just knocking-he‚Äôs kicked the door down. Feels like his redemption arc is aligning with another England tour. Life really comes full circle.

I really hope Virat finds form soon, but if he doesn‚Äôt score in the first two Tests, I think it would be fitting for Karun Nair to get a shot in the third. It would be poetic, considering everything.

And coming back to Rayudu‚Äîlove him or hate him, I‚Äôve followed his journey since his U-19 days. The man has seen countless lows and still kept fighting. Criticizing his opinions is fine, but personal attacks are just not okay. I wish more people could watch his recent podcast on YouTube, it‚Äôs in Telugu, but it‚Äôs raw, honest, and sheds a lot of light on what he went through.",1,1745136179.0

Dhoni's influence got so strong that even after the IPL fixing scandal, his fandom got enlarged. I haven't seen such a superstar in Indian cricket. Cricket is not only about scoring tons of runs and taking plenty of wickets, it's also about man-management. Dhoni is the best in this aspect.

If you don't like his commentary, stop watching it. You can't force anyone to say the things you want. I know why Rayudu does that. The broadcasters want him to talk about Dhoni all the time. He knows if he talks about Dhoni all the time, he will get more views and clicks which can be used to ask for even more money. If you keep talking about his shit commentary, he will keep doing the shit commentary. Ignore him and he might not find it worthwhile to be glazing Dhoni all the time. Dhoni haters talk about his commentary more than Dhoni fans do. This shows that whatever he is doing is working on people and he is getting even more engagement than usual.",1,1745135208.0

Complain about it to the broadcasters then. Write them a mail or something. How is posting the same comment every time Rayudu's name comes up on a subreddit going to help with it? 

Ever since this IPL started, I'm seeing the same comments every single day on this sub. Saying it once or twice is fine. But there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of comments daily talking about the same bullshit we have talked about multiple times.

1k30g7t,mnyh18d,Key_Grapefruit_5248,"A cricket bat is only 3.2 cms wider than the cricket ball which can swing, turn, bounce, drift, and drop while traveling at speeds of up to 150kmph that is capable of killing a fully-grown adult if not played the right way and severe injury if you don't read it correctly. Add to that the pitch conditions, nature of the ball itself, weather, how long the ball has been in play for, and reverse swing that completely changes how the ball behaves even on the same pitch even at different times of the same day.  If you don't middle it perfectly with the correct form, bat-swing, footwork, and head position, it doesn't go where you want it to. You play it a quarter-second early, you miss it, you play it a quarter-second late, you hit it up in the air to be caught. And even if you account for ALL of these things and play the shot perfectly, if you don't play according the dimensions of the field and the positions of the 10 fielders standing around you, you will get out.

And the way you need to handle this aspect of the game changes over the course of the match, depending on how many overs are left, how many runs have been made and/or need to be scored, how much time is left in the day, how many bowlers are yet to come, and how many wickets are left. And this is in an era when batting is the easiest than it ever was before. Every single factor I mentioned was more difficult decades ago.

This is all just one factor of the game, not even considering fielding, wicket-keeping, and bowling. Put it all together and you'll understand why millions upon millions of people have dedicated their lives to this sport over centuries.",3,1745083536.0

1. Mohammad Shami has been playing in IPL since 2013 but has never been seen as a good t20 bowler until 2022. This is when his first breakthrough season came with GT followed by an unreal dream like season in 2023.


2. Hardik Pandya started bowling with a new ball in 2022 which he never did with MI.


3. Mohit Sharma who was lost in the ambush, surfaced out of nowhere and called as a net bowler by GT in 2022 and had a dream season in 2023, he was just two balls away from single handedly winning GT back to back titles.


4. Sai Kishore who was benched by CSK for eternity, has slowly got his reckoning and despite of having quality spinners like Rashid, Noor, Jayant Yadav, slowly made his mark in 2022 and 2023 and come 2024 he was a regular feature in the XI. His potential was clearly recognised by GT and despite of having players like Shami, Miller in mega auction they used their only RTM to retain Sai Kishore.


5. Mohammad Siraj, clearly infamous for his inconsistency and volatile perfomances, seems to have found a home at GT. Just like Shami he is a rhythm bowler and needs hands on his shoulder to give a freedom to execute his plans on the field without fear of failure.


6. Prasidhh Krishna, this is the most impactful story so far. Many cricket pundits have written him off and labelled him as a red ball bolwer critisizing his tendency of going for runs. While that's true, there's some work done behind the doors and you can see that. Nehra & co. are clearly smart and understands the game of individuals. They haven't given new ball to krishna and used him in middle overs and asked him to back his natural strength which is back (hit the deck hard) of the length. Guy looks to be so calm and comfortable in the role he is expected to perform.

Kudos to gt for winning it once again. Their top order has been great this season.

Kohli's aggregate of 973 was 125 more than David Warner's 848, but in terms of Smart Runs Warner's tally was worth 935.52 runs to Kohli's 925.24. Kohli's strike rate of 152.03 was similar to Warner's 151.42, but that does not tell the real story. In the matches Kohli played, the average scoring rate was 9.22 runs per over, while the matches involving Warner only saw a rate of 8.05. In Bengaluru, the home venue for Kohli, the average strike rate was 149.34, while in Hyderabad, Warner's home venue, the average strike rate was 121.19. Also, Kohli had much better support, with AB de Villiers and KL Rahul also making substantial scores: the other RCB batsmen scored at a strike rate of 153.91 in the season, while the other Sunrisers batsmen scored at only 120.04. In a relatively weak line-up Warner was clearly the star, and because he consistently batted under greater pressure the difference between his Smart Runs and conventional runs tally is much higher.",-3,1745057527.0

Pant's and Russell's performance get overshadowed because they played in the middle so weren't able to showcase a huge aggregate . Gayle's 2011 is often forgotten because people didn't really value SR in those days but he averaged 70 @ 187 while batting at Chinnaswamy when the par score there was 143 his 2011 season was the biggest anomaly in T20 cricket we've ever witnessed.

It's just the toxic fans of RCB I can't handle, sadly all the people I know personally who are RCB fans are toxic except a handful. I was an undergrad student when one friend told me that she won't troll CSK if they lose (I agree I trolled RCB then but it was because they said 2018 IPL tournament win was because of spot fixing), so I said let's see then when Jaddu became the captain, she didn't even spare a single second to take a break from trolling CSK. I mean why say that we won't troll, we know how it is to be trolled and then troll? I troll my RCB friends who take it sportively, one friend asked me to hide her from my status if I wanna troll RCB and I respect that. I don't troll RCB when I know they'll be offended and then troll us back and expect me to not get offended. When I troll my friends who take it sportively, I'll definitely accept your trolls when CSK performs bad, I just take it with a pinch of salt and let it be. I met some wonderful RCB fans on this sub as well and they're chill RCB fans, I enjoy talking to them but the toxic fans are the people I don't like. Again I'm not calling the whole fan base toxic but I stay away from the toxic fans. One friend of mine says he's a cricket fan and once I was listening to a YT short in which the creator trolled Kohli for chasing outside off balls. My friend got offended and all, asked me not to listen to his videos. I mean seriously? One time he was talking to my other RCB fan who isn't toxic, the topic came up about CSK and MI, he said CSK cheats and MI buys the umpires so now you understand what he means by cricket fan. I don't talk to him about cricket anymore now, I might sound like a toxic CSK fan but fighting or trolling over cricket is the last thing on my list now.",16,1745014198.0

In my personal experience, I just feel toxic RCB fans are just more toxic from the rest of the toxic fans of other franchises. I met many toxic fans of other franchises like MI, SRH (yes last year I met a shit ton of them) and so on who would diss about CSK but they sorta stay in their limits, if you would say. Now I don't mean any disrespect for RCB fans, stay in their limits is just a figure of speech in this sentence. Like I said some toxic RCB fans troll CSK after a loss, I just stay quiet and let it be. But they don't stop, I get up to leave and they follow and all, then when I get offended because I can only take so much they say bruh it's just a game or how do you think we felt you guys did it to us. Bruh the best I do is just one status and that's it, for that I don't need you to come banging on my door or following me wherever I go. And if you guys say that you won't troll CSK or any other team for losing then stick to it, why the double standards? That's all, if you aren't a toxic fan then we'll get along just fine.

Actually ya that's a remarkable feat and I was truly happy for RCB, they did awesome! But probably show courtesy to the other team as well, I mean teams who actually won the WC would also line up sooner than them.

Dude, this is a troll post. His comment here is also a ragebait. Don't tell me you genuinely believe whatever he has put out here. And OP has himself already generalized the subreddit here, of course he's going to get flamed.

>And OP here is not pointing towards any group here. So you don‚Äôt have to take offence at ‚Äúwe‚Äù. A disgusting post like the one I shared got so much upvotes means you get reactions. 

OP points to r/ IPL and [""9 other teams""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipl/s/1VBuL0JQrh)

r/ IPL always eggs on the team which loses. I thought that was a known fact. If you're inserting yourself into bad faith discussions then, idk, it's upto you. You can always turn to the mods here but bait posts here has become a common feature. Just restrict yourself to the subs/threads which have good faith discussions if you want somebody to ""listen to you"".

>This post is not rage bait or trolling and it only offends those who believe it is our ‚Äúturn‚Äù today to get trolled and OP can‚Äôt complain about it because he is answerable for the entire fanbase and he must have enjoyed trolling others.

Tell me honestly, did you really, I mean REALLY, get offended by the post which you're sharing?

I don't know about you but I would rather have a post made of KKR fans like the one you have shared than have someone with a KKR flair cry about being the victims.

If you agree this sub likes to dunk on losing teams then OP here is not wrong. He just feels it is going overboard when it comes to RCB example the post I shared. I have not seen a post like that made against another franchise fanbase getting posted or upvoted in this sub.

Last 51 T20 innings, since BBL 2024         
Entry Point         

After > 10 overs:      
14/51 innings: 27.5%       
FAIL%: 71.4%      

Before < 10 overs:        
37/51 innings: 72.5%           
FAIL%: 32.4%         

https://imgur.com/a/cqS8AVn

Summary: Maxwell fails A LOT when he comes to bat after the 10 over mark. As compared to when he comes earlier and has time to get set. He is actually a very consistent top order player. 

He has played more than 10 balls roughly 60% of the time, but it only happened 3 times when his entry point was after the 11th over. That‚Äôs 3 out of 30 innings. Maxwell REALLY needs to spend time in the middle. The days of him attacking from ball one are LONG gone. The sooner the management and Maxwell himself understand this, the sooner he returns to form. In fact, when he was captain in the BBL, he played himself in the top 4 and had a lot of success. The same goes for Australia. They used him as a top order batsman. If someone like Maxwell hits at 4, it‚Äôs going to have a lot more impact than a Wadhera. And Nehal is young, and has proven he can be a reliable finisher too.",2,1744961344.0

1k1y7lb,mnql8ga,Curious-Response-49,"I don't get why everyone is saying this. Both the matches they lost they also lost the toss which was a huge factor, especially in Chinnaswamy. All the batters kept going for it, aiming for a 200-220 total, only to bundle for around 160-170 both matches. And if you see the second innings too, initially the batters found it hard to play, until like the 12th or 13th over when they started bashing. So even if they bat first, the RCB batters should take time and go bonkers at the end. I think they'll easily win atleast 1/2 against PBKS, who seem more prone to a choke because of their weak middle order",14,1744973392.0

It's the same thing for fielding restrictions. What did the bowler do if a fielder doesn't walk back into the inner circle on time. That's how it is sometimes. 

The laws were written before there was a free hit so if they want to remove the advantage of a free hit, they can simple make the ball already delivered as a free hit. All runs count but if the batsman gets dismissed, there's no wicket. And maybe add 1 extra run as an extra.

If the kick is a goal or is sent outside the post these checks are not done as it's not considered part of the play.. similarly yesterday Rickelton was out caught by an outfield fielder so it shouldn't matter if Klassen had his gloves before the wicket...

1k1kkub,mnqgl75,unlinedd,"> Batting and bowling both seem to be equally huge problems. In fact batting at least clicked a couple of times unlike bowling.

In all games SRH lost, batting failure was the bigger issue, posting significantly below par scores.

Bowling is also a concern for sure. Shami in particular has been absolutely horrendous, going for way too many runs. The worst part is the absolute lack of any thinking in bowling which is not what one would expect from someone so experienced. I mean he bowled one full toss after another in the 20th over vs PBKS and got hit with 4 sixes in an over. He was lucky Stoinis wasn't on strike on the first ball of the over otherwise it might have been 5 sixes. Cummins and Harshal have been good, Zeeshan decent and most others have been a disappointment (Simarjeet and Shami have put on some of the worst bowling performances this IPL).

> Ishan was always a gamble buy

I think he's tied with Nitish Reddy being the biggest disappointments this season. I mean he's been completely sidelined from the national team, not even in consideration. He has the most to prove, and the only way to do it is to make consistent runs, and he's just not been among the runs.

> They sacrificed lower order backups

The backup player situation is really bad. Last year they had like enough players to field two teams (Glenn Philips did not get a chance at all, Washington Sundar played like one or two matches).

> They could've played nkr at 3

If anything it might be time to have him come at lower order like at 6 or 7. He played at that position in the BGT and did really well. After his century, he started to come earlier and failed there.


> klaasen at 4

He's also not been  so good - no big scores. He looks likes he's in and playing really well then he suddenly gets out, this has been happening this whole IPL.

> All batsmen batting out of position seems to be one of the issues rn

I don't think this is the issue. And they're not really playing very out of position.

> All successful teams this season have at least one quality spinner and one good backup to control the MO while Pat doesn't even trust in zampa

Zampa was part of original plan I think but they were forced to bring others due to batting collapse. Then Zampa got injured and had to leave. Spin definitely a problem.",1,1744970770.0

What I am saying is, Dhoni cannot be an Impact Player at all because he has to keep/provide tactical inputs to Ruturaj, and he also has to be available to bat. Thats why even in last season, Dhoni was never used as an Impact Player. Even if CSK selected a gun batting squad, Dhoni was never planned to be used as the Impact Player (and he even said this in an interview before this season that he cannot be the Impact Player because he is needed everywhere). 

The rule did not happen because of him. Its already getting lot of criticism and likely to be removed in coming seasons. We will see if it coincides with Dhoni's retirement.",1,1744921523.0

The ""sophomore slump"" in sports refers to a decline in performance by an athlete during their second season compared to their successful rookie year

Reasons for the Sophomore Slump:

Increased Expectations:
Players may be expected to replicate or exceed their rookie year performance, which can create pressure and anxiety. 

Increased Scouted by Opponents:
Opponents and coaches have more game film on the player, allowing them to better prepare and exploit weaknesses. 

Potential for Regression to the Mean:
Statistical regression suggests that exceptional rookie year performances may be followed by a return to a more average level. 

Complacency:
Some players may relax their efforts after a successful rookie year, leading to a drop in performance. 

Burnout and Lack of Motivation:
The demands of professional sports can lead to burnout and a decline in motivation. 

Mental Game:
Issues like low self-confidence, over-motivation, or difficulty surpassing mental barriers can contribute to a slump. 

Personal Issues:

An umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batter, not having been given out, has left the wicket under a misapprehension of being out.¬† The umpire intervening shall call and signal Dead ball to prevent any further action by the fielding side and shall recall the batter.¬†

The issue is that there is always a loose ball every one and a half to two overs, every time, there's never a drought of boundaries because someone will always bowl a ball that will release the pressure.

He generally is a decent bowler but can be very expensive. He's a proper batter but can't really go from ball 1. The Impact Rule has affected his value since teams don't need that kinda profile, especially an overseas one. Then there's the fact that WI are having a poor time in white ball and Holder hasn't done anything of note.

As to ur point about Morris and Curran, both are better death bowlers (when in form) than Holder. Morris can hit big, from ball 1, & is atleast 10 kph faster than Holder on avg. Curran might hv similar pace & batting to Holder, but he's a left armer which is a more valuable profile. Curran was also the PoTT in 22 T20 WC iirc.

That‚Äôs why he can‚Äôt focus and deliver. Honestly, he‚Äôs a far better batsman than Jaiswal, Gill, and many others. He and Karun Nair *should* be opening the innings for India.  
  
For **SRH** they should be like  
**Abhishek,**  
**Ishan(Wicket Keeper),**  
**Nitish(Captain)**.. Make this guy as captain  
**Travis Head**  
**Klassen**..  So on..   
  
Ishan should be keeping, because that's what helps him in his batting. Klassen should be more working on first slip. It's a tactical move SRH and Patty isn't able to think through.

And when Ishan was in MI, he should be walking out with Rohit, but nope, the internal politics have completely screwed up his form.

***It's like making ABD play like Rahul Dravid, and making Rahul Dravid or Ajinkya play like Sehwag or Gayle kind of fooling around tactics. Same thing we have done to so many Indian players.***

***Or better example, asking Yuvi and Virat to play like Dravid, and asking Jurel or Ajinkya or DK to play like ABD or more flamboyant. It doesn't work like that.. People should respect the way some players are and how they approach the game, and let them play their natural game.***

And don‚Äôt even get me started on the whole Hardik Pandya captaincy thing. He‚Äôs clearly not ready as a leader, He don't have what it takes to be captain. Santner is miles ahead in terms of captaincy skills, yet he‚Äôs being treated like an optional extra for MI, just like Rohit Sharma is played like impact player. It‚Äôs so illogical, it's almost laughable.

**It‚Äôs like having Shane Watson or Steve Waugh in Rajastan Royals team or Aussie team and keeping them benched while handing the captaincy to someone like Symonds or Clarke. We‚Äôre seeing this flawed thinking in every team now.**

Now they have this Sanju Samson as captain. Sure good captain, but its' too spoon feeding control by Rahul Dravid. Sure good coach but too much trying hard to control losings the direction. They don't have any replacement or backing of captain too in RR team, and that's being done by Rahul Dravid which is hurting them. And no one realizes it. 

**Take Nitish Reddy, a better future Indian material for ODI/T20 captaincy. But he's made to play like an extra for SRH while they lean on Pat Cummins. Patty sure is good, but Nitish deserves leadership responsibility. He got what it takes to be leader for SRH.**

Same thing happened with Rahane. He‚Äôs a natural fit for Test captaincy, not IPL. Now KKR gives him the role while they have someone like Venkatesh Iyer, who‚Äôs more suited to leading the squad in this format.

Axar Patel is another underrated captain, perfect for DC, and they‚Äôre doing well, but still missing one thing: Karun Nair at the top of the order.

Ishan Kishan , man‚Äôs a top-class player. But if you treat your players like trash, what do you expect in return? Same goes for someone like Maxwell, if you don‚Äôt know how to use him, don‚Äôt blame him for not clicking. While he happily performs back in Aussie team. Typical.

unfortunately, there is a loud minority who give the fan base a bad name. it is also unfortunate that those rage baiters comments and posts are the ones that get posted (despite not being the top comments or even an upvoted post, they will just find the one that matches their confirmation bias) on this sub as proof that rcb has the most toxic fan base. And that just continues to feed the bias. 

This bias also sometimes leads to a meme or just funny banter to be taken as being hateful and toxic which is sad to see because banter is fun! People banter rcb all the time and if it is funny it's funny. I laugh! but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be both ways most of the time.",2,1744906733.0

1k1c75v,mnm6kmv,theaguia,for those big innings nowadays you need lot of things to go your way and maybe play slower initially. you cant play too slowly with such deep batting.

Coming to why it was given to Starc instead of Axar, potm is not solely based on numbers, it also depends highly on the situation you were in and your impact in the win of the team, and Starc was obv ahead in that aspect. That also explains why Dhoni got it instead of Noor, Noor did bowl brilliantly but Dhoni was the reason CSK managed to cross the line in the game and his impact was way more important.",4,1744898720.0

Axar conceeded just 23 runs in 3 overs and scored 34 at strike rate of around 240. But they choose starc because of the impact and the situation he was in. He defended 9 in last over and conceeded 11 in super over. He was super consistent with his yorker length. I don't think many people will have problem with that.

However they messed up completely in LSG vs CSK. Dhoni didn't deserve that and even he told himself that Noor Ahmed deserved that for his brilliant bowling. Noor conceeded just 13 runs in 4 overs.",3,1744894394.0

I said in the recent BGT first 3 test matches. Bumrah was in the form of his life, dominating over every Aussie batter except for Head. In Head's century, he actually went after Bumrah the most, more than run a ball in Tests. If the series was a three match series then Head might have gotten Player of the Series as Head had runs every match till third match.

Head then failed in the fourth match (both innings) and fifth match (first inning).

> got out in t20wc too

Got out but not before smacking him quite well. Head did his job that day. It's just that other Aussie batters could not do so well, and mainly Rohit had played extraordinarily that day.

> Only time he could play well was odiwc finals that too because of dew.

Each team plays other teams in their group and a team in the same row in the other group twice.

This is the group for this season.

Ex. MI plays all teams in group B and CSK from A twice.

The groups are selected by IPL based on previous performance and Seeding of a team.

There will be a total of 74 group matches this season. There is an expectation to increase that to 84 next season. If all teams play each other home/away it will be 94.[more here](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2025-with-player-workload-in-mind-no-increase-in-number-of-matches-played-1452783)",3,1744888523.0

Teams are divided in two groups. You play twice with teams of the same group (home and away). And once with teams of another group (either home or away). And to have equal number of home and away matches for each team, there will be one more match with one team from the different group.

I think the actual concerns are: lack of gaps between games for some teams (game today, travel tomorrow, game in another city next day - no gap day between matches).

There is also disparity in the amount of travel each team has to do. In this IPL, DC and SRH for example have limited travel but others like RCB have to cover huge distances.

Another is home matches scheduled together. This should be similar for all teams",1,1744892017.0

Based on total number of super overs played as a percentage of total matches the probability is 1.36%. ¬†Now again for a super overs being being tied assuming the likely scores are in the range of 1-20, for both teams, the probability of the scores being tied is 5%, but this doesn‚Äôt account for the fact that similar conditions provide similar scores and that chasing team try to imitate or go after the target in hand increasing the probability of super overs being tied getting tied, which empirically is close to 6.67% (considering we got one instance out of all super overs).¬†

Looking at it in another way and extrapolating from 50 overs to 20 overs and the number of tied super overs (closer the format gets, higher the probability, for a super overs being being tied probability is closed to 17.24%)- assuming the probability increased in a logarithmic manner.

Averaging all the probabilities, probability of super overs being getting tied is close to 9.3%.¬†

Combine that with match getting into super overs into first place the total probability is 0.093*0.0136=0.00126. So maybe in next 793 matches (approx 11 seasons) we might see one more such instance.",2,1744888281.0

There was no winning from that auction. All the 11/12 players clicked last season and there wasn't a single weak link. If there was, it was well-covered by the others. So no matter what happened at the auction, the team would've come out weaker. 

Spending 23 crs on Venky was a mistake but there weren't many options left and other bidders were smart to make KKR overspend on him. 

KKR had a terrific bowling line up last year. And they successfully managed to keep 5/6 bowlers of them. That's a great job that doesn't get enough credit. 

The issue with the batting is that it was always meant to perform as a unit. Even last year, you didn't see just one or two player carrying it. It was a collective effort. And the moment the team stopped clicking, it's been exposed. And motivation plays a big part. 

I think KKR's season is over. They will fight for the 6th or 7th spot. Losing like that breaks your morale and dressing room. I don't think they will recover from that this season.",25,1744865394.0

1k0re0k,mnhlacn,ThatsWhatTheKidSaid,"nope, you always go to your best bowler in case of super over. Sandeep was neevr the right choice, the target was not much, Rahul and Stubbs both are classic batters and not sloggers like JFM who'd just hit blindly. Even a kid would know they'll pick slower ones pretty easily, and Sandeep would either bowl slower bouncer, wide yorker or yorker. He doesn't have any pace to play with. You just need to watch the ball, and the plan was short ball or blockhole given the field setup. Even Stubbs said in post match presentation that they knew Sandeep will bowl slower bouncer. 

No matter what but you back your best bowler in crunch situations. Sandeep has defended runs in the past, but they've been more than 15-20 most of the times, where even if you're hit for a few, you can manage. Here it was only 12 runs to play with. Jofra could've used his pace, back of the hand bouncers, wide yorkers, yorkers. Having pace and yorkers are always good option no matter how the game evolves.

If he is playing good
And the batsman on the other end goes out he falls quickly too

He only plays as long as he can see there is batting left after him

He doesn't take responsibility


Edit

And let's say you still want to play qdk
Atleast put him on no 4 send rahane or raghuvanshi to open

The anchor role he should play. 
As he is not having good season. 
He should be the anchor when wickets fall. 
I think they should send QDK after venky and rinku 

He is not helping narine in any way

If narine can see the batsman on the other end is unpredictable which is supposed to be him

How can he swing every ball

Of course the other batsman have to improve

Honestly Russell was fit last year

The championship is still in his mind

He is very sloppy",0,1744825412.0

1k0or9l,mnftmc7,Shaswat_here,bro that was expected de cock was a huge downgrade on salt and narine has not fired in any leagues across the world after ipl 24 so there was no expectation from them it was middle order which had experience and has played with each other and looked settled,1,1744823199.0
1k0or9l,mnfulj7,Shaswat_here,Shreyas thing was both side fault I feel after a point of time it became an ego issue for both sides and that is why we saw venky going for shreyas in this auction but stopping around 8 crores with cheeky smile. Rahane can fill in that anchor role even yesterday if he took the review things would have been different it is not shreyas we are missing it is salt which we are missing a lot more who took the game away in powerplay only from teams and then they were just doing catchup,1,1744823477.0
1k0or9l,mng3t1e,Shaswat_here,I think we are having a problem to make a place for Raghuvanshi last year it was the sweet spot where openers give you a start opposition is already in backfoot then he gets a buffer and then he can wait for bad balls and hit for 4s but expecting him to play as a basher is problematic his sweet spot is around 5 to 10 overs where spin is introduced. Problem is like what we had in BGT they were not able to play first 30 overs here openers are not able to play till 5 overs,1,1744826070.0

He is the perfect match for narine

Rahane is best at no 3. 
Plays good. 
Doesn't need too much balls to set. 
Plays good cricket.

And send venky more after 2 wickets fall. 
KKR is too much reliant on narine's luck.
Most of the players think that wicket of narine is huge loss in the kkr camp.",1,1744826556.0
1k0or9l,mng71fv,jim2509,"Well every other teams are sending their emerging player too bat more

KKR should too

Look at all the bowlers

They are fine bowlers now

Do that with raghuvanshi too

Make him open

You are trying new things with narine
