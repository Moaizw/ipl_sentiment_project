1k4i41j,moaecs2,historyguy84,"As the other commenter said, it's not a 0 or 1 thing. Ball tracking, like every other technology, has a precision error that comes into play whenever the ball is in that uncertain zone on the sides/top of the stumps. They could just say that everything in that error zone is out or not out, but they choose to go with the umpire's call because as per the laws of cricket, technology is to assist the umpires who have the final say. There's even a law that says that if the fielding side doesn't appeal for a clear dismissal, the umpires don't have to give it out. Clearly cricket respects umpires way more than other sports do for their referees, and it's okay for now. Probably will change as the game evolves.",1,1745256860.0

1k47ev7,mo839pg,shreyank97,">⁠DC has tougher fixtures than RCB. DC is playing four Top 5 teams (GT, RCB, LSG, PBKS) and also an in-form MI. RCB on the other hand gets to play 4 weak teams (CSK, RR, SRH, KKR).

How is the fixture difficulty translated numerically?

>DC’s top 2 chances are higher because of the same reason. They either go all in and beat teams like RCB and GT or they lose altogether.

These aren't the only two possibilities though. Most realistically, they will win some and lose some. 

>Also DC current form is poor. 2 losses in the last 3 and the 1 win came from a super over

Again, how is something like a super over win translated numerically? 


Another factor would be that RCB is winning all their away matches and losing all their home matches (true even now after more than half the season) which could be extrapolated to something like a 14 - 7 - 7 finish.

U can say he didn't get many chances. Dhoni got 10 shots at ICC tournaments (including 6 in WT20s) but Virat just got 3 out of which 1 was a Toss WC. He eventually would've won titles.

Klaasen hasnt lived up to his retain amount (Kohli and Pooran have similar salaries but are top in orange cap list)
NKR was supposed to be the backbone of SRH this time, but they have been tumbling after Travishek fall. 

LSG:

Pant, 27cr but worst batting performances. Saving grace has been that LSG is doing really good despite their primary bowlers Mayank/Mohsin being injured. 

KKR:

Venky iyer hasnt looked at his best till now, looks like money overspent. 
Russell looks like a shell of his former self, needs to step up as KKR look to be stuck in the middle of the table.

RCB:

overspent on Rasikh but he hasnt played much. If he was going to be a backup why spend that high? (it was a RTM call)

Livi has been poor, someone like Phillips/Bracewell would have been a better buy for the same job.

CSK: 
They didnt make too expensive buys but I would say Ashwin, for the amount he has been paid, isnt living up to it. 

Rachin wasnt that expensive, but he had lots of expectations but has failed continuously.

Hooda/Tripathi have been pathetic.

MI: 

Jacks needs to go back to his 2024 RCB form, this will literally make MI end up in top2 given their legacy.
Chahar has scope for improvement too.

DC:  JFM. everyone else has contributed, except faf who has been injured so wont include him here.

RR: oh, too big a list. All their retentions have fumbled games. No one looking like a matchwinner. Jaiswal giving away wicket after scoring 50s.

1. RCB 2009 (Finished 4th)


They rode a wave late in the league stage and made it to the final under the old system. If the current format was in place, they’d have faced a steeper path, maybe wouldn't have made it that far.




2. Deccan Chargers 2009 (Finished 2nd)


They won the IPL that year, despite a rocky group stage. With today's format, they might have had to beat more consistent teams twice. Not a sure thing.




3. Kolkata Knight Riders 2014


Won 9 in a row to lift the trophy. But imagine if they had a semifinal format instead of the extra advantage from finishing in the top 2—they could’ve gone out in one knockout game.




4. Sunrisers Hyderabad 2016

1k3ttkb,mo5c0b4,patel4994,"Let's analyze the sequence:
0, 8, 13, 17, 18, 26, 76, ?

We'll look at the differences between consecutive terms:

8 - 0 = 8

13 - 8 = 5

17 - 13 = 4

18 - 17 = 1

26 - 18 = 8

76 - 26 = 50


Now observe the pattern in differences:
8, 5, 4, 1, 8, 50

The pattern seems irregular, but let’s try to find any repetition or logic.

Looking at the jump from 18 to 26 (+8) and then 26 to 76 (+50) — a big leap — maybe a hidden pattern or a mathematical function is in play.

Let’s try checking:

18 to 26 is +8

26 to 76 is +50


It might be that the large jump (50) relates to a pattern resetting.

Another way to look at it:
The 6th term is 76, which is 26 × 2 + 24
That may not help directly.

Let’s check a possible next jump: If the previous jump was +50, and if that jump is increasing dramatically, maybe:

Try to continue the pattern of jumps:
8, 5, 4, 1, 8, 50 → next could be 49 (decrease by 1?)

Then:
76 + 49 = 125

Alternatively, observe that:

0 to 8 = 2³

8 to 13 = +5

13 to 17 = +4

17 to 18 = +1

18 to 26 = +8

26 to 76 = +50


Still irregular...

Possibility: It's a custom or puzzle-based sequence, maybe the differences are primes or derived from another logic.

But based on the pattern of adding 8 and 50 near the end, a reasonable guess would be:

Next number = 76 + 49 = 125

So, the next number is likely 125 (according to all knowing Chatgpt).",8,1745181332.0

Personally don't think it's a fanbase or even a cricket problem. I think it's just people's discontentment towards life, which they are channeling through social media or any chance wherever there is some kind of majority in their favor.

Just got back from the CSK vs MI match this evening (20th April), and I have to say—the MI fans were incredibly sportive. I could support my team, they supported theirs. Lots of fun banter, but zero intimidation or disrespect. Genuinely earned a lot of respect from me. Hats off to the Mumbai crowd.

Chinnaswamy, on the other hand, has always been a rough experience for me. The crowd has never been friendly—intimidating behavior, name-calling, and in one instance, people even pulled at my T-shirt. It’s just not a welcoming environment for an away fan.

Fact of the matter is: the Chinnaswamy crowd tends to be aggressive. And that kind of crowd mentality only intensifies things further. RCB fans really need to step up and fix this, because it’s not a good look.

Name your franchise after a region even though the franchise has got nothing to do with the region except that it's just based there (KL Rahul from Bangalore plays for DC, Kohli from Delhi plays for RCB), create emotional narratives around every franchise, try to associate every team with some star players so people can fight like dogs about the players they support as well.

You can troll me all you want but the truth is what I just said. Hardcore IPL fans have a tribalistic idea of being a fan. You just have to take the middle ground: you can support your team without trolling other teams, view players as players and not demigods. And view franchises as franchises. Not your identity. Even if CSK screws up this year, it's the fans who are going to whine about a team of athletes who don't even know those fans exist. Those teams will continue to play games and receive huge salaries.

Khaleel and Pathirana to open the bowling. Pathirana to bowl 17th and 19th overs. Rachin or Dube also need to pitch in with a couple of overs depending on the match situation. Stop relying on spin choke. None of our spinners are good enough for that. And spin choke doesn't matter when our bowlers are trying to defend miniscule targets or the opposition knows all they need is 190 runs to put the match beyond us.   
  
As for batting - there needs to be a hard target of 60 runs MINIMUM in the powerplay irrespective of wickets lost. Even if we lose wickets, these batters need to get into the mindspace of batting with intent. Between Overs 7-14 we need to target 65-70 runs at least. The finishing will be whatever happens.

The amount of people who advocate for this kind of aggression is just ridiculous to me. Bhai sab shanti se khel rhe hai, tum bhi shanti se dekho aur enjoy kro, what's the need of unnecessary toxicity, ye gdho ko har jagah bas ladai aur dange hi chahiye, khud to miserable hai hi, dusro ko bhi jindagi jhand chahte hai.

I legit saw someone saying that they are not interested in cricket because it doesn't have agression like football and I get that every one has their preferences on what they want to watch, but what is this fascination towards toxicity. One person commented that IPL has ruined cricket, and they didn't gave any valid criticism like how it's just a slog fest, no competition between bat and ball, monopoly or something like that. No, instead their complain was that because of IPL everyone has become buddies with everyone and now you don't see any agression on the international level.

And one can't compare cricket to football. Cricket is a slow sport with tons of breaks and ads that break the flow of the game. It is not as athletic as the ISL.

The ISL can't be compared to the IPL because fans in the ISL really care for their respective team because it represents their city and culture. 

And since football is a shorter sport with little to no ads and breaks, it can be easily watched in a stadium. 

Also, since the ISL is a contact sport, there is bound to be increased passion and flared tempers. One simply cannot expect the IPL and the ISL to be similar.",2,1745217504.0

Another reason could be that he was dropped from the world cup when Kohli was the captain. So to him only MI and CSK deserve to win the trophy lol.",3,1745168665.0

Finn Allen is a much better T20 player for both NZ and in franchise cricket

Rachin is not even an NZ bully in T20I's

I'd give credit to Rachin for being a great prospect in ODI and Test format

The only time CSK has come useful for him was that he used their training facilities for a few weeks last year before playing that test series in India where NZ completely whitewashed us and dealt a blow to our chances to qualify for the 23-25 WTC final before we got dethroned in BGT at Australia

So you mean Sandeep going for 25–30 in the last over of two close games and maybe the upcoming ones too is totally fine? We’re just supposed to sit back and “support” that? Wow, he gave 30? Amazing! Let’s hope he gets the last over next match too ! champion stuff 👑 

As for Jurel , nobody’s denying he has potential, but IPL is a what-you-do-now format, not an internship. He’s been frozen under pressure in match after match. Teams like MI build cores with consistent performers, not just young names thrown into high-stakes situations without form or fire. He’s got talent, but he’s looked completely out of place this season.

He is immensely talented and the talk in Hyderabad cricket circles was that he was the next Sachin. 

But, with talent, he also had a lot of attitude. Nothing unusual. He picked up fights on and off the ground with the powers to be then. Arjun Yadav, Shivlal Yadav’s son had a constant fight with him because Arjun was captain of the team and Rayudu was not listening to him on the field.

Of course Rayudu might have his reasons and HCA officials are no saints. They are infact one of the most corrupt organisations in Indian Cricket. 

He got unofficial banned in Hyderabad cricket, tried morning to Andhra or Chhattisgarh but still had his share of problems. He also joined ICL, IPLs rival tournament at the risk of getting banned by BCCI and not playing for India ever. Because he never thought he’ll even get selected. 

I think only because of Mumbai Indians and their clout, he got back into IPL and then got into CSK ecosystem and to ICT. 

I only wonder how much Indian cricket would have benefited if only it has Rayudu playing regularly from the start of his career, without controversies. Raw talent wise, he’s on par with Rohit or Virat.

Now honestly that is such a big thing for any player and anyone getting that kind of a treatment and respect from a franchise are bound to stay indebted to them. Also he got a literal fairytale dream end to his career at csk which is pretty rare in sports.

Even in his last year,2023, the indelible knock that he played in the finals, leading Csk to win was one of the best i had seen, especially that six on the backfoot of Mohit Sharma's bowling(best bowler on that night) over covers, perfectly encapsulates the talent he had.

But let’s be honest, if Virat had truly wanted Rayudu in the squad, there’s no way MSK had the authority to overrule that. Everyone knows how these things work behind the scenes.

In a recent Telugu podcast, Rayudu himself mentioned that he had even received his Indian team jersey for the World Cup. That’s how certain his selection was, only to be dropped last minute. No one deserves to be treated like that. And honestly, it's not just about Rayudu.

Take Karun Nair for example. The guy scored a triple century, then had a few low scores, and suddenly he was out. He was picked for the England Test tour in 2018 under Virat’s captaincy-a five-match series where India was struggling. Karun was in the squad the whole time but never got a game. Then out of nowhere, they flew in Hanuma Vihari and played him ahead of Karun.Then they dropped him from squad without any explanation. Imagine being there, getting sidelined like that. The psychological toll must’ve been huge.

Every time Karun scores now, most of us feel genuinely happy for him because we know how unfairly he was treated. The guy hit rock bottom but never gave up. And now? He’s not just knocking-he’s kicked the door down. Feels like his redemption arc is aligning with another England tour. Life really comes full circle.

I really hope Virat finds form soon, but if he doesn’t score in the first two Tests, I think it would be fitting for Karun Nair to get a shot in the third. It would be poetic, considering everything.

And coming back to Rayudu—love him or hate him, I’ve followed his journey since his U-19 days. The man has seen countless lows and still kept fighting. Criticizing his opinions is fine, but personal attacks are just not okay. I wish more people could watch his recent podcast on YouTube, it’s in Telugu, but it’s raw, honest, and sheds a lot of light on what he went through.",1,1745136179.0

Other guys are correct, Dhoni got so much power due to the fact that the board was controlled by Srini, but that's not the only reason. A few things we should remember, we wanted a world cup, Sachin wanted a world cup, Dhoni made the wishes come true after 28 years (don't be a Gambhir here, the whole team gets the credit but again, the captain definitely gets the advantage). Dhoni's influence got so strong that even after the IPL fixing scandal, his fandom got enlarged. I haven't seen such a superstar in Indian cricket. Cricket is not only about scoring tons of runs and taking plenty of wickets, it's also about man-management. Dhoni is the best in this aspect. Remember, Sachin left the captaincy due to the pressure of his batting performance, but also it was the darkest days in Indian cricket (Azharuddin's fixing scandal). So, that's the reason why I said that Dhoni is the biggest superstar in Indian cricket.",2,1745185676.0

Professionals aren't supposed to be biased towards one side. Rayudu didn't stop after that emotional moment either. I remember gaurav Kapoor saying in his podcast that usually there's a director in the commentators ears telling the presenters what way the conversations should go to and what topics to avoid or quickly wrap up etc. either jio/star has been asking rayudu to stay impartial cause of all the attention it has been getting or he has been willfully ignoring the man in his ear out of admiration of dhoni.

1k30g7t,mnyh18d,Key_Grapefruit_5248,"A cricket bat is only 3.2 cms wider than the cricket ball which can swing, turn, bounce, drift, and drop while traveling at speeds of up to 150kmph that is capable of killing a fully-grown adult if not played the right way and severe injury if you don't read it correctly. Add to that the pitch conditions, nature of the ball itself, weather, how long the ball has been in play for, and reverse swing that completely changes how the ball behaves even on the same pitch even at different times of the same day.  If you don't middle it perfectly with the correct form, bat-swing, footwork, and head position, it doesn't go where you want it to. You play it a quarter-second early, you miss it, you play it a quarter-second late, you hit it up in the air to be caught. And even if you account for ALL of these things and play the shot perfectly, if you don't play according the dimensions of the field and the positions of the 10 fielders standing around you, you will get out.

And the way you need to handle this aspect of the game changes over the course of the match, depending on how many overs are left, how many runs have been made and/or need to be scored, how much time is left in the day, how many bowlers are yet to come, and how many wickets are left. And this is in an era when batting is the easiest than it ever was before. Every single factor I mentioned was more difficult decades ago.

This is all just one factor of the game, not even considering fielding, wicket-keeping, and bowling. Put it all together and you'll understand why millions upon millions of people have dedicated their lives to this sport over centuries.",3,1745083536.0

1k30065,mny5lim,way__to__eternity,"warning: too long to read

1. Mohammad Shami has been playing in IPL since 2013 but has never been seen as a good t20 bowler until 2022. This is when his first breakthrough season came with GT followed by an unreal dream like season in 2023.


2. Hardik Pandya started bowling with a new ball in 2022 which he never did with MI.


3. Mohit Sharma who was lost in the ambush, surfaced out of nowhere and called as a net bowler by GT in 2022 and had a dream season in 2023, he was just two balls away from single handedly winning GT back to back titles.


4. Sai Kishore who was benched by CSK for eternity, has slowly got his reckoning and despite of having quality spinners like Rashid, Noor, Jayant Yadav, slowly made his mark in 2022 and 2023 and come 2024 he was a regular feature in the XI. His potential was clearly recognised by GT and despite of having players like Shami, Miller in mega auction they used their only RTM to retain Sai Kishore.


5. Mohammad Siraj, clearly infamous for his inconsistency and volatile perfomances, seems to have found a home at GT. Just like Shami he is a rhythm bowler and needs hands on his shoulder to give a freedom to execute his plans on the field without fear of failure.


6. Prasidhh Krishna, this is the most impactful story so far. Many cricket pundits have written him off and labelled him as a red ball bolwer critisizing his tendency of going for runs. While that's true, there's some work done behind the doors and you can see that. Nehra & co. are clearly smart and understands the game of individuals. They haven't given new ball to krishna and used him in middle overs and asked him to back his natural strength which is back (hit the deck hard) of the length. Guy looks to be so calm and comfortable in the role he is expected to perform.

Kudos to gt for winning it once again. Their top order has been great this season.

Kohli's aggregate of 973 was 125 more than David Warner's 848, but in terms of Smart Runs Warner's tally was worth 935.52 runs to Kohli's 925.24. Kohli's strike rate of 152.03 was similar to Warner's 151.42, but that does not tell the real story. In the matches Kohli played, the average scoring rate was 9.22 runs per over, while the matches involving Warner only saw a rate of 8.05. In Bengaluru, the home venue for Kohli, the average strike rate was 149.34, while in Hyderabad, Warner's home venue, the average strike rate was 121.19. Also, Kohli had much better support, with AB de Villiers and KL Rahul also making substantial scores: the other RCB batsmen scored at a strike rate of 153.91 in the season, while the other Sunrisers batsmen scored at only 120.04. In a relatively weak line-up Warner was clearly the star, and because he consistently batted under greater pressure the difference between his Smart Runs and conventional runs tally is much higher.",-3,1745057527.0

1k2qak2,mo239ph,No_Swimmer_6820,"IPL isn't a test league where aggregate runs are all that matter. Kohli had a brilliant 2016 but it's worth remembering that his own teammate had a SR of 155 while he struck at 150.

Pant's and Russell's performance get overshadowed because they played in the middle so weren't able to showcase a huge aggregate . Gayle's 2011 is often forgotten because people didn't really value SR in those days but he averaged 70 @ 187 while batting at Chinnaswamy when the par score there was 143 his 2011 season was the biggest anomaly in T20 cricket we've ever witnessed.

I was an undergrad student when one friend told me that she won't troll CSK if they lose (I agree I trolled RCB then but it was because they said 2018 IPL tournament win was because of spot fixing), so I said let's see then when Jaddu became the captain, she didn't even spare a single second to take a break from trolling CSK. I mean why say that we won't troll, we know how it is to be trolled and then troll? I troll my RCB friends who take it sportively, one friend asked me to hide her from my status if I wanna troll RCB and I respect that. I don't troll RCB when I know they'll be offended and then troll us back and expect me to not get offended. When I troll my friends who take it sportively, I'll definitely accept your trolls when CSK performs bad, I just take it with a pinch of salt and let it be. I met some wonderful RCB fans on this sub as well and they're chill RCB fans, I enjoy talking to them but the toxic fans are the people I don't like. Again I'm not calling the whole fan base toxic but I stay away from the toxic fans. One friend of mine says he's a cricket fan and once I was listening to a YT short in which the creator trolled Kohli for chasing outside off balls. My friend got offended and all, asked me not to listen to his videos. I mean seriously? One time he was talking to my other RCB fan who isn't toxic, the topic came up about CSK and MI, he said CSK cheats and MI buys the umpires so now you understand what he means by cricket fan.

In my personal experience, I just feel toxic RCB fans are just more toxic from the rest of the toxic fans of other franchises. I met many toxic fans of other franchises like MI, SRH (yes last year I met a shit ton of them) and so on who would diss about CSK but they sorta stay in their limits, if you would say. Now I don't mean any disrespect for RCB fans, stay in their limits is just a figure of speech in this sentence. Like I said some toxic RCB fans troll CSK after a loss, I just stay quiet and let it be. But they don't stop, I get up to leave and they follow and all, then when I get offended because I can only take so much they say bruh it's just a game or how do you think we felt you guys did it to us. Bruh the best I do is just one status and that's it, for that I don't need you to come banging on my door or following me wherever I go. And if you guys say that you won't troll CSK or any other team for losing then stick to it, why the double standards? That's all, if you aren't a toxic fan then we'll get along just fine. Also a lot of the hate stems from last year RCB vs CSK match, when RCB celebrated as if they won the IPL, didn't like up to shake hands with the CSK team and the fans outside were even worse.

Actually ya that's a remarkable feat and I was truly happy for RCB, they did awesome! But probably show courtesy to the other team as well, I mean teams who actually won the WC would also line up sooner than them. Sure they give hugs and pounce on each other but they don't ""rub the salt"" into the losing teams wound. So ya just a bit of courtesy would have been appreciated.

r/ IPL always eggs on the team which loses. I thought that was a known fact. If you're inserting yourself into bad faith discussions then, idk, it's upto you.

Only Salt and David should be the ones trying to hit boundary every ball because that's what their role is in the team. Kohli needs to anchor if the opening partnership breaks early. No one else in the team is capable of anchoring. DDP should be backed, I have no idea why they randomly benched him today. Get rid of Livi asap and give a chance to Bethell/Romario. Patidar and Jitesh need to play smartly and according to the situation. Krunal isn't doing shit as a batter and he should come after David.

Against DC he didn't bowl the 4th over on the trot but gave the bowling to Livingstone who went for 14 that over.

Suyash stats were 3-12-1 , by the time Patidar brought him back the game was in DC favour.


Against PBKS today too after Hazelewood's first over he was removed, Patidar bring in Krunal who went for 10 runs ( a large number of runs in sub 100 chase)

Compared to Shreyas who didn't even brought in his 5th bowler until it was absolutely required.

The last 2 overs went for 32 runs but with just 63 runs scored in first 12 overs ,the job was well done by PBKS .

But that didn’t sit well for Dale and his IPL career was forgettable. Later he preferred to opt out of IPL and famously chose to play PSL, playing it to the galleries that “in IPL, cricket gets forgotten, whereas PSL and LPL is more about cricket.” But this great lover of “more cricket in franchise led t20 tournaments” played 9 games in total for PSL and LPL compared to his 95 in IPL.

(I think he knew he wasn’t getting picked in any IPL team after 2020/21 and got a bit frustrated?)

Water was so expensive but definitely worth it to stay hydrated, and we didn’t eat any of the food apart from the ice cream as I was a little unsure about how long it had been out for. The stadium was so well organized, clean, safe and easy to navigate. Leaving was pretty crazy, but after walking for a bit we could get an Ola easily enough.

Last 51 T20 innings, since BBL 2024         
Entry Point         

After > 10 overs:      
14/51 innings: 27.5%       
FAIL%: 71.4%      

Before < 10 overs:        
37/51 innings: 72.5%           
FAIL%: 32.4%         

https://imgur.com/a/cqS8AVn

Summary: Maxwell fails A LOT when he comes to bat after the 10 over mark. As compared to when he comes earlier and has time to get set. He is actually a very consistent top order player. 

He has played more than 10 balls roughly 60% of the time, but it only happened 3 times when his entry point was after the 11th over. That’s 3 out of 30 innings. Maxwell REALLY needs to spend time in the middle. The days of him attacking from ball one are LONG gone. The sooner the management and Maxwell himself understand this, the sooner he returns to form. In fact, when he was captain in the BBL, he played himself in the top 4 and had a lot of success. The same goes for Australia. They used him as a top order batsman. If someone like Maxwell hits at 4, it’s going to have a lot more impact than a Wadhera. And Nehal is young, and has proven he can be a reliable finisher too.",2,1744961344.0

This is also RCBs issue. One area of the team is lacking. They also drop some crucial catches at times. RCBs bad performance is a combination of subpar captaincy (even though for a debutant Patidar's captaincy is decent), bad erratic influence of Kohli & lackluster execution

It's the same thing for fielding restrictions. What did the bowler do if a fielder doesn't walk back into the inner circle on time. That's how it is sometimes. 

The laws were written before there was a free hit so if they want to remove the advantage of a free hit, they can simple make the ball already delivered as a free hit. All runs count but if the batsman gets dismissed, there's no wicket. And maybe add 1 extra run as an extra.

If the GK saves the penalty they check whether the opposite players have infringed the box before the kick was taken or GK stepped out of the line before the kick was taken..

If the kick is a goal or is sent outside the post these checks are not done as it's not considered part of the play.. similarly yesterday Rickelton was out caught by an outfield fielder so it shouldn't matter if Klassen had his gloves before the wicket... If this is the case are they gonna check every bowl because I am sure Klassen must have gotten his hands ahead of stumps in more than one occasion..

A batter may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery, unless it is the final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the instant when the umpires leave the field.

And before someone starts arguing about the definition of a dead ball, a dead ball means that it is no longer in play. Thus overthrows, and other extras won't be counted from that point onwards.

1k1kkub,mnqgl75,unlinedd,"> Batting and bowling both seem to be equally huge problems. In fact batting at least clicked a couple of times unlike bowling.

In all games SRH lost, batting failure was the bigger issue, posting significantly below par scores.

Bowling is also a concern for sure. Shami in particular has been absolutely horrendous, going for way too many runs. The worst part is the absolute lack of any thinking in bowling which is not what one would expect from someone so experienced. I mean he bowled one full toss after another in the 20th over vs PBKS and got hit with 4 sixes in an over. He was lucky Stoinis wasn't on strike on the first ball of the over otherwise it might have been 5 sixes. Cummins and Harshal have been good, Zeeshan decent and most others have been a disappointment (Simarjeet and Shami have put on some of the worst bowling performances this IPL).

> Ishan was always a gamble buy

I think he's tied with Nitish Reddy being the biggest disappointments this season. I mean he's been completely sidelined from the national team, not even in consideration. He has the most to prove, and the only way to do it is to make consistent runs, and he's just not been among the runs.

> They sacrificed lower order backups

The backup player situation is really bad. Last year they had like enough players to field two teams (Glenn Philips did not get a chance at all, Washington Sundar played like one or two matches).

> They could've played nkr at 3

If anything it might be time to have him come at lower order like at 6 or 7. He played at that position in the BGT and did really well. After his century, he started to come earlier and failed there.


> klaasen at 4

He's also not been  so good - no big scores. He looks likes he's in and playing really well then he suddenly gets out, this has been happening this whole IPL.

> All batsmen batting out of position seems to be one of the issues rn

I don't think this is the issue. And they're not really playing very out of position.

> All successful teams this season have at least one quality spinner and one good backup to control the MO while Pat doesn't even trust in zampa

Zampa was part of original plan I think but they were forced to bring others due to batting collapse. Then Zampa got injured and had to leave. Spin definitely a problem.",1,1744970770.0

Thats why even in last season, Dhoni was never used as an Impact Player. Even if CSK selected a gun batting squad, Dhoni was never planned to be used as the Impact Player (and he even said this in an interview before this season that he cannot be the Impact Player because he is needed everywhere). 

The rule did not happen because of him. Its already getting lot of criticism and likely to be removed in coming seasons. We will see if it coincides with Dhoni's retirement.",1,1744921523.0

The ""sophomore slump"" in sports refers to a decline in performance by an athlete during their second season compared to their successful rookie year

Reasons for the Sophomore Slump:

Increased Expectations:
Players may be expected to replicate or exceed their rookie year performance, which can create pressure and anxiety. 

Increased Scouted by Opponents:
Opponents and coaches have more game film on the player, allowing them to better prepare and exploit weaknesses. 

Potential for Regression to the Mean:
Statistical regression suggests that exceptional rookie year performances may be followed by a return to a more average level. 

Complacency:
Some players may relax their efforts after a successful rookie year, leading to a drop in performance. 

Burnout and Lack of Motivation:
The demands of professional sports can lead to burnout and a decline in motivation. 

Mental Game:
Issues like low self-confidence, over-motivation, or difficulty surpassing mental barriers can contribute to a slump. 

Personal Issues:
Adjusting to the pressures and demands of professional sports can create personal challenges that affect performance.",5,1744916178.0

An umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batter, not having been given out, has left the wicket under a misapprehension of being out.  The umpire intervening shall call and signal Dead ball to prevent any further action by the fielding side and shall recall the batter. 

A batter may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery, unless it is the final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the instant when the umpires leave the field",6,1744922707.0

The issue is that there is always a loose ball every one and a half to two overs, every time, there's never a drought of boundaries because someone will always bowl a ball that will release the pressure.

He generally is a decent bowler but can be very expensive. He's a proper batter but can't really go from ball 1. The Impact Rule has affected his value since teams don't need that kinda profile, especially an overseas one. Then there's the fact that WI are having a poor time in white ball and Holder hasn't done anything of note.

As to ur point about Morris and Curran, both are better death bowlers (when in form) than Holder. Morris can hit big, from ball 1, & is atleast 10 kph faster than Holder on avg. Curran might hv similar pace & batting to Holder, but he's a left armer which is a more valuable profile. Curran was also the PoTT in 22 T20 WC iirc.

That’s why he can’t focus and deliver. Honestly, he’s a far better batsman than Jaiswal, Gill, and many others. He and Karun Nair *should* be opening the innings for India.  
  
For **SRH** they should be like  
**Abhishek,**  
**Ishan(Wicket Keeper),**  
**Nitish(Captain)**.. Make this guy as captain  
**Travis Head**  
**Klassen**..  So on..   
  
Ishan should be keeping, because that's what helps him in his batting. Klassen should be more working on first slip. It's a tactical move SRH and Patty isn't able to think through.

And when Ishan was in MI, he should be walking out with Rohit, but nope, the internal politics have completely screwed up his form.

***It's like making ABD play like Rahul Dravid, and making Rahul Dravid or Ajinkya play like Sehwag or Gayle kind of fooling around tactics. Same thing we have done to so many Indian players.***

***Or better example, asking Yuvi and Virat to play like Dravid, and asking Jurel or Ajinkya or DK to play like ABD or more flamboyant. It doesn't work like that.. People should respect the way some players are and how they approach the game, and let them play their natural game.***

And don’t even get me started on the whole Hardik Pandya captaincy thing. He’s clearly not ready as a leader, He don't have what it takes to be captain. Santner is miles ahead in terms of captaincy skills, yet he’s being treated like an optional extra for MI, just like Rohit Sharma is played like impact player. It’s so illogical, it's almost laughable.

**It’s like having Shane Watson or Steve Waugh in Rajastan Royals team or Aussie team and keeping them benched while handing the captaincy to someone like Symonds or Clarke. We’re seeing this flawed thinking in every team now.**

Now they have this Sanju Samson as captain. Sure good captain, but its' too spoon feeding control by Rahul Dravid. Sure good coach but too much trying hard to control losings the direction. They don't have any replacement or backing of captain too in RR team, and that's being done by Rahul Dravid which is hurting them. And no one realizes it. 

**Take Nitish Reddy, a better future Indian material for ODI/T20 captaincy. But he's made to play like an extra for SRH while they lean on Pat Cummins. Patty sure is good, but Nitish deserves leadership responsibility. He got what it takes to be leader for SRH.**

Same thing happened with Rahane. He’s a natural fit for Test captaincy, not IPL. Now KKR gives him the role while they have someone like Venkatesh Iyer, who’s more suited to leading the squad in this format.

Axar Patel is another underrated captain, perfect for DC, and they’re doing well, but still missing one thing: Karun Nair at the top of the order.

Ishan Kishan , man’s a top-class player. But if you treat your players like trash, what do you expect in return? Same goes for someone like Maxwell, if you don’t know how to use him, don’t blame him for not clicking. While he happily performs back in Aussie team. Typical. You see Warner, Max, Travis, Klaaseen.

unfortunately, there is a loud minority who give the fan base a bad name. it is also unfortunate that those rage baiters comments and posts are the ones that get posted (despite not being the top comments or even an upvoted post, they will just find the one that matches their confirmation bias) on this sub as proof that rcb has the most toxic fan base. And that just continues to feed the bias. 

This bias also sometimes leads to a meme or just funny banter to be taken as being hateful and toxic which is sad to see because banter is fun! People banter rcb all the time and if it is funny it's funny. I laugh! but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be both ways most of the time.",2,1744906733.0

1k1c75v,mnm6kmv,theaguia,for those big innings nowadays you need lot of things to go your way and maybe play slower initially. you cant play too slowly with such deep batting. I think consistent 30ish runs at over 150+ sr incredibly valuable maybe more than 1 hundread and then multiple poor scores. look at what Salt is doing for rcb. completely changes and opens the game up. salt only has 2 50s (one of them he had 2 drops) yet one of the best openers in ipl this season so far.,1,1744909688.0

Axar conceeded just 23 runs in 3 overs and scored 34 at strike rate of around 240. But they choose starc because of the impact and the situation he was in. He defended 9 in last over and conceeded 11 in super over. He was super consistent with his yorker length. I don't think many people will have problem with that.

I said in the recent BGT first 3 test matches. Bumrah was in the form of his life, dominating over every Aussie batter except for Head. In Head's century, he actually went after Bumrah the most, more than run a ball in Tests. If the series was a three match series then Head might have gotten Player of the Series as Head had runs every match till third match.

Head then failed in the fourth match (both innings) and fifth match (first inning).

> got out in t20wc too

Got out but not before smacking him quite well. Head did his job that day. It's just that other Aussie batters could not do so well, and mainly Rohit had played extraordinarily that day.

> Only time he could play well was odiwc finals that too because of dew.

It would increase the length of the tournament and they didn't want to disrupt the cycle. So they formed 2 groups of 5. Each team plays other teams in their group and a team in the same row in the other group twice.

This is the group for this season.

Ex. MI plays all teams in group B and CSK from A twice.

The groups are selected by IPL based on previous performance and Seeding of a team.

There will be a total of 74 group matches this season. There is an expectation to increase that to 84 next season. If all teams play each other home/away it will be 94.[more here](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2025-with-player-workload-in-mind-no-increase-in-number-of-matches-played-1452783)",3,1744888523.0
1k1791c,mnklr38,unlinedd,"> I seriously don’t know why there are teams who play two matches against another team and then there are few teams who play only one match. Why is that?

Teams are divided in two groups. You play twice with teams of the same group (home and away). And once with teams of another group (either home or away). And to have equal number of home and away matches for each team, there will be one more match with one team from the different group.

I think the actual concerns are: lack of gaps between games for some teams (game today, travel tomorrow, game in another city next day - no gap day between matches).

There is also disparity in the amount of travel each team has to do. In this IPL, DC and SRH for example have limited travel but others like RCB have to cover huge distances.

Another is home matches scheduled together. This should be similar for all teams",1,1744892017.0

1k165jp,mnkcyo3,Puzzleheaded-Dot7989,"Let’s do the math.

Based on total number of super overs played as a percentage of total matches the probability is 1.36%.  Now again for a super overs being being tied assuming the likely scores are in the range of 1-20, for both teams, the probability of the scores being tied is 5%, but this doesn’t account for the fact that similar conditions provide similar scores and that chasing team try to imitate or go after the target in hand increasing the probability of super overs being tied getting tied, which empirically is close to 6.67% (considering we got one instance out of all super overs). 

Looking at it in another way and extrapolating from 50 overs to 20 overs and the number of tied super overs (closer the format gets, higher the probability, for a super overs being being tied probability is closed to 17.24%)- assuming the probability increased in a logarithmic manner.

Averaging all the probabilities, probability of super overs being getting tied is close to 9.3%. 

Combine that with match getting into super overs into first place the total probability is 0.093*0.0136=0.00126. So maybe in next 793 matches (approx 11 seasons) we might see one more such instance.",2,1744888281.0

KKR had a terrific bowling line up last year. And they successfully managed to keep 5/6 bowlers of them. That's a great job that doesn't get enough credit. 

The issue with the batting is that it was always meant to perform as a unit. Even last year, you didn't see just one or two player carrying it. It was a collective effort. And the moment the team stopped clicking, it's been exposed. And motivation plays a big part.

The curator refuses to give us a pitch which we find favourable and continues to role out flaties to help out others.And unlike the common belief,it turns out the franchise actually can't have a real say regarding the pitch,can only request some.

The curator continues to give out arrogant statements,but refused to help out team out.

Our auction may have gone wrong and a hundred other things,but we didn't do what you have commented.",8,1744867646.0

Sanju and Jaiswal seems disinterested in whatever the hell is going on inside. Jurel seems clueless. Rana now has two great innings,

1k0re0k,mnhlacn,ThatsWhatTheKidSaid,"nope, you always go to your best bowler in case of super over. Sandeep was neevr the right choice, the target was not much, Rahul and Stubbs both are classic batters and not sloggers like JFM who'd just hit blindly. Even a kid would know they'll pick slower ones pretty easily, and Sandeep would either bowl slower bouncer, wide yorker or yorker. He doesn't have any pace to play with. You just need to watch the ball, and the plan was short ball or blockhole given the field setup. Even Stubbs said in post match presentation that they knew Sandeep will bowl slower bouncer. 

No matter what but you back your best bowler in crunch situations. Sandeep has defended runs in the past, but they've been more than 15-20 most of the times, where even if you're hit for a few, you can manage. Here it was only 12 runs to play with. Jofra could've used his pace, back of the hand bouncers, wide yorkers, yorkers. Having pace and yorkers are always good option no matter how the game evolves.

He doesn't take responsibility


Edit

And let's say you still want to play qdk
Atleast put him on no 4 send rahane or raghuvanshi to open

The anchor role he should play. 
As he is not having good season. 
He should be the anchor when wickets fall. 
I think they should send QDK after venky and rinku 

He is not helping narine in any way

If narine can see the batsman on the other end is unpredictable which is supposed to be him

1k0or9l,mng3t1e,Shaswat_here,I think we are having a problem to make a place for Raghuvanshi last year it was the sweet spot where openers give you a start opposition is already in backfoot then he gets a buffer and then he can wait for bad balls and hit for 4s but expecting him to play as a basher is problematic his sweet spot is around 5 to 10 overs where spin is introduced.
